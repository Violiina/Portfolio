<h4>Hi, I am Fireknight</h4>

    <p1>I have just started studying game technologies at XAMK - University of Applied Sciences, after a couple years of running around aimlessly and pondering what to do with my life. I studied previously in IB (International Baccalaureate) in English, and worked on the side as a freelance Finnish-English translator.</p1>

    <p2>I mostly started playing video games after failing utterly at concentrating on my studies in high school, starting with whatever games I had seen my sisters play as a little kid, from puzzle games to Star Stable. My addiction grew year by year, and after a while I found myself getting interested in the background and creation of games. Nowadays I mostly play single-player games, like the Assassin's Creed series, but sometimes I find myself in MMORPGs, like Black Desert Online.</p2>

    <p3>As a self-taught artist, I'm still finding my style in drawing and painting, be it digital or traditional art. I have done small projects/commissions for others for a small payment - I actually started quite young, at the age of 7 - but I mostly draw for my own amusement's and progression's sake. I always aim to use only my own works in my projects (if I'm not feeling particularly lazy), all of the pics used in this portfolio are done by my hand as well. I do also dabble in video and music editing, Project 1 being one example, and I'm currently studying animation by drawing as a side hobby.</p3>
